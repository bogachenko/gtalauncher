I made a curtsy of the company Rockstar Games and bought the games: Grand Theft Auto - San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto - Vice City and Grand Theft Auto III to play on the network. But I did not find the controller program. I want to change this. I created simple programs for launching the game itself and various multiplayer programs for playing on the network.
